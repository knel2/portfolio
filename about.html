      <h1>About Me</h1>
      <p>
        Currently I got off a very restful break where I mainly hanged out with family,
        watched spanish soap opreas and went to the gym to go swimming/cardio workouts.
        Out of comming of my break I'm excited to be able to start off this quarter strong and
        getting to learn more about web development and how to make interactive websites through
        creativity in coding.

      <h3>One of my favorite quotes</h3>
      <!--
        Note: We'll learn about semantic tags more this week, but an article is a good semantic
        choice here to group the information about a single quote and the author/source. If
        you want to have multiple quotes, try duplicating this "card UI" structure (the class
        website has a good example of a "card UI" structure in the instructor/TA cards).

            You may say I'm a dreamer, but I'm not the only one. I hope someday you'll join us.
            And the world will live as one.
